# prework-study-guide

## Description [^1]

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

- reading through the course material brought about the motivation to put the learnings to practice
- by using my scrupulous sence of organization, I decided to make a simple flow of the practice material 
- This helps with organizing each class notes and refering back to them ad-hoc. 
- By doing so I learned the following:
    - git commands and flow;
    - html structure and syntax;
    - CSS structure and syntax;
    - JavaScript structure and syntax;
    - coding fundamentals and best practices.

## Installation

All you need is a web browser and access to internet in order to use this tool.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
